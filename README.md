# N Queens Solver

## Overview

The N Queens Solver project addresses the classic N Queens problem, where the objective is to place N queens on an N x N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This problem is solved using both Java and Python implementations, showcasing different approaches and coding techniques in these languages.

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Utilizes a recursive approach with backtracking to place queens on the board while avoiding conflicts.
- **Multiple Solutions**: Capable of finding all possible valid arrangements of queens.
- **Dual Language Implementation**: Available in both Java and Python for comparative analysis and versatility.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Accepts an integer `N` representing the size of the chessboard and the number of queens.
2. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Recursively places queens on the board, ensuring no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.
3. **Constraint Checking**: Validates each placement of a queen to ensure compliance with the rules.
4. **Solution Output**: Displays all valid configurations of queens on the board.

## Installation

### For Python

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n-queens-solver.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd n-queens-solver/python
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies** (if applicable)
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### For Java

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n-queens-solver.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd n-queens-solver/java
   ```
3. **Compile and Run**
   ```bash
   javac NQueensSolver.java
   java NQueensSolver
   ```

## Usage

### Python

1. **Run the Solver**
   ```bash
   python n_queens_solver.py
   ```
2. **Input Format**: Enter the value of `N` to specify the size of the chessboard and the number of queens.

### Java

1. **Run the Solver**
   ```bash
   java NQueensSolver
   ```
2. **Input Format**: Enter the value of `N` in the command line arguments.

## Examples

Provide a few examples of solutions for different values of N to illustrate how the solver works.

### Example 1: N = 4

**Input**
```python
n = 4
```

**Output**
```plaintext
Solution 1:
[1, 3, 0, 2]
[0, 2, 3, 1]
[3, 0, 2, 1]
[2, 1, 0, 3]

Solution 2:
[2, 0, 3, 1]
[3, 1, 0, 2]
[0, 3, 1, 2]
[1, 2, 3, 0]
```

### Example 2: N = 8

**Input**
```python
n = 8
```

**Output**
```plaintext
Solution 1:
[0, 4, 7, 5, 2, 6, 1, 3]
[4, 7, 0, 2, 6, 1, 3, 5]
[7, 0, 4, 1, 3, 5, 6, 2]
[5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 0, 1]
[2, 6, 1, 7, 4, 0, 5, 3]
[6, 1, 3, 0, 5, 7, 2, 4]
[1, 3, 5, 4, 0, 2, 7, 6]
[3, 5, 2, 6, 1, 7, 4, 0]
```
